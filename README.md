This repository contains my work from the British Airways job simulation on the Forage platform, where I gained hands-on experience in data science and analytics within the airline industry.

Project Overview
In this simulation, I worked on analyzing customer purchasing behavior by leveraging web scraping, data analysis, and machine learning. The key tasks included:

Web Scraping: Extracted and collected customer data for analysis.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Processed raw data to remove inconsistencies and prepare it for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified trends and patterns in customer behavior using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Feature Engineering & Machine Learning: Built and trained a predictive model to understand factors influencing buying decisions.
Data Visualization: Created insightful visualizations to present key findings.
Presentation & Business Insights: Compiled results into a PowerPoint report to communicate actionable insights effectively.
Key Takeaways
This project reinforced my ability to handle real-world data from scraping and preprocessing to modeling and presenting insights. It also strengthened my skills in Python, data analysis, and machine learning, confirming my passion for leveraging data to drive business decisions.
